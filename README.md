# Movie-Data-Analyzer

Prediction engine for movies used to identify factors that contribute to a movie's succsess. The data stems from The Movie Database's API and YouTube's API. The APIs were used to pull data such as popularity scores, actor information, vote averages and more found on IMDB for movies from 2015 and 2016, as well as YouTube comments pertaining to videos affiliated with these movies. Our final results were accumulated into a poster that was presented for Boston University Computer Science faculty.
